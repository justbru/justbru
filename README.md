- 👋 Hi, I’m Justin Brunings, a third-year Computer Science major at California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo
- 👀 I’m interested in artificial intelligence and finance (stock market). When I'm not focused on code, I enjoy swimming, cycling, hiking, playing the guitar, and spending time with friends
- 🌱 I have a background in Java, Python, C, React, and Javascript. I have knowledge of data structures, computer organization, and systems programming for each language and I am currently learning about a multitude of different programming languages (Racket, Haskell, C#, etc.)
- 💞️ I am currently working as a software engineer intern at Norhrop Grumman but I'm open for summer 2023 recruiting!
- 📫 You can reach me via email at jbruning@calpoly.edu or via cell at (425)-623-4167
